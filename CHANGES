At the request of some people, here is a Change log starting with 0.33.0.
Enjoy! :)


Changes from 0.33.3 to 0.33.4:
	- corrected a typo in the sample Blackbox.ad file to correctly show
	  which resource to set for the menu file
	- added moderate window group support for programs like netscape and 
	  other motif applications... modified window stacking code and
	  internal list code to support window groups (this makes transients
	  behave properly... another step towards more complete ICCCM
	  compliance)
	- modified focus event handlers to stop applications from focusing out
	  when pressing menubars... also window focus is returned to root if 
	  the focus window is closed... if another window is under the focus
	  window when it is closed... that window is awarded input focus
	- fixed tiny little bug that didn't move the close button when resizing
	  a window


Changes from 0.33.2 to 0.33.3: 
	- changed some of the menu code ("updated" in 0.33.1) back to the
	  original 0.33.0, which seems to perform better.  Reason behind it? -
	  blackbox died too often with 0.33.1/2
	- added "Kill Client" option to window menus... for those applications
	  that don't accept the WM_DELETE_WINDOW atom
	- menus that are not partially moved off the root window are shifted to
	  a visible position when the pointer enters the frame... it is also
	  shifted back to it's original position when left (this is new... let
	  me know how it works)


Changes from 0.33.1 to 0.33.2: (unreleased)
	- changed BlackboxIcon to not try and read its config when it was
	  created.  This was forgotten from the 0.31.0 -> 0.33.0 move :/


Changes from 0.33.0 to 0.33.1: (unreleased)
	- improved menu handling, less possibilty for SIGSEGV
	- menus now make copies of all label, exec strings and titles, to
	  make less loose pointers
	- fixed typo to allow submenus of submenus of submenus (...)
	- fixed workspace menu and window list menu placements


Changes from 0.31.0 to 0.33.0:
	- added #ifdef statements so the C preprocessor doesn't complain about
	  _GNU_SOURCE being redefined.
	- changed internal resource data structures
	- added Sticky windows functionality
	- remove old animation code bound with #ifdef ANIMATIONS
	- fixed a silly little bug that sometimes mapped a submenu when its
	  parent was unmapping itself
	- added ExecReconfigure option to execute a shell statement before
	  performing reconfiguration
	- rearranged window config code to reduce wait time while resizing
	- added internal macro BImageNoDitherSolid to make window frame
	  rendering faster (dithering a solid image is silly anyway)
	- added new menu file format
	- added Blackbox::validateWindow to provide a stabler environment for
	  Blackbox.  This gives blackbox more error checking and greater
	  stability.  For me, random crashes have (nearly) disappeared.
	- removed window name/class dependant frame texture/color
	- with 0.31.0, each entity read it's configuration from the rc database
	  loaded at start.  this has changed back to the old behaviour of
	  reading all configuration parameters at start, no database reads are
	  performed after the initial setup (save for reconfiguring).
	- configuration has changed to be a little cleaner, and a little more
          thorough.  See the Blackbox.ad and BlackboxMenu.ad for exmaples.
