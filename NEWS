0.75            Maintenance Release 0.75

    This is a maintenance release of the blackboxwm package. This package
    contains a maintained fork of the original blackbox CVS that is on
    Sourceforge. It includes all of the official blackbox CVS repository,
    as well as patches collected from pdl-linux, Debian, the blackbox bug
    list, other GitHub forks. It also includes greatly enhanced EWMH/ICCCM
    compliance. See COMPLIANCE in the release for additional information on
    enhanced compliance.

    This release is a maintenance release whose sole purpose is to update
    the build system, generate a better NEWS file, handle annotated tags
    better, and converts the release archives to lzip compression.

    Included in the release is an autoconf tarball for building the release
    from source. See the NEWS and TODO file in the release for more
    information. Please report problems to the issues list on GitHub.
