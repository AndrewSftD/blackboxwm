*** %%% *** NOTE *** %%% ***
Blackbox's configuration system has completely CHANGED as of 0.2x.x.  All
previous configurations will NOT WORK with this release.  This is the reason
for a 0.2x.x release.  Please read the following text so that you can adapt
your current configuration to the new format.
*** %%% ***      *** %%% ***

This file covers operation and configuration of Blackbox.  Since it is
still in development, many things may or may not work properly (or at
all).  This code was written from scratch (save for a bit of the 8bpp
code, which was reimplemented from WindowMaker 0.11.0 source code (and
has since been improved upon and operates much faster than the way
WindowMaker does, which is to alloc colors for each image), and the
dgradient code.

NOTE:  The 8bpp code is unfinished and mostly untested.  I do not make
any guarantees or promises that you can run blackbox on an 8bpp X
server.  I plan to work on the 8bpp code more, but at the moment it is
unfinished and should be considered pre-alpha quality.

UPDATE: The 8bpp code has been considerably reworked and is working.  As
a note, blackbox does a fake match color allocation method (ala
WindowMaker) when it is run on an 8bpp X server.  What this means is
that (for example) a slate blue root window will most likely NOT be the
same color as a slate blue title bar window.  Please, no bug reports
about improper coloring, as this is the method I have decided to use
because of the way I render and use internal images.

Compilation and Installation:
--------------------------------
Blackbox uses an Imakefile to better configure and allow for various
system types.  Compiler flags, libraries and paths are automatically set
in the various imake rules and templates files.

Edit the Imakefile and #define the options that you want compiled into (or
outof) blackbox.

To fully compile and install blackbox, issue the following commands:
	xmkmf -a
	make
	make install (as root, for permissions)

Each user should edit their appropriate .xinitrc or .xsession files to
use the newly installed blackbox executable file.


Operation:
-------------
Operation of blackbox is similar to many other window managers.  An
explanation of functions and their default behaviour (read, some
behaviours are modifiable/configurable) is included below.

Window Stacking (arrangement):
	Windows are stacked in a specific order.
	The toolbox set on the bottom of the root window is always on the
	bottom of the stack list.  Icons and client windows are
	stacked above the toolbox, thus it is possible to totally
	obscure the toolbox from site with large/numerous clients.  The
	session (root) menu, workspace manager menu and the workspace menus
	(window lists) are stacked above the client windows, and thus will
	always be visible when mapped.

	Client window stacking order is modifiable by clicking on the
	window titlebar or the window handle bar. Mouse button 1 (by
	default, the left mouse button on a right handed mouse, which is
	modified in the X configuration files, not by blackbox) raises
	the window to the top of the stack (under any transient windows,
	such as help/about/question dialog boxes).  Mouse button 2 (by
	default the middle mouse button) lowers the window (and any
	transient windows) to the bottom of the window stack.

	Client windows are movable by holding mouse button 1 on the
	titlebar and dragging the window to the desired location.  This
	is an opaque move (the window contents are visible during the
	move) and as of yet, the only option for moving windows.  A wire
	frame move may be implemented, provided requests for it are
	made.  Releasing the mouse button ends the window move.
  
ICCCM Compliance:
	Since blackbox is an ICCCM compliant window manager, the window
	decorations are controlled by messages and defaults set by the
	client.  If a client does not accept a certain ICCCM protocol
	request, then a close button (the "X" button) will not b
	 created.  Likewise, if a client sets its maximum and minimum
	size to the same settings, a maximize button (the box button)
	will not be created, nor will a window handle, since the window
	cannot be resized.  The ICCCM specifications allow for an Urgent
	window to be created, but at the moment blackbox ignores such
	windows (as the ICCCM allows).  If such windows are supported in
	future releases, the iconify button (the bar button) will not be
	created.  In this release, the iconify button is created for all
	windows.

	Clients that report a user or program specified location are
	accomodated, and placed in the appropriate location.  Otherwise,
	client windows are cascaded when mapped (which cycles back when
	necessary).  If a client wishes to resize itself or reposition
	itself, its request is honored.

	Support is also available for older (read: pre ICCCM) clients
	that behave differently than described in the ICCCM
	specification included with the X11R6.3 release of the X Window
	System.  Most notable of such clients is xv, which is the
	primary graphics viewer/editor for many people (read: Linux
	users).

Window Operations:
	Client windows that allow resizing will have a handle added to
	the decorations.  To interactively resize a window, the button
	at the bottom of the handle should be pressed with mouse button
	1 and drug to the desired location.  If the client has reported
	a size stepping/increment, this increment is taken into account
	when the resizing begins.  Resizing is controlled by a wire
	frame, which is removed when the mouse button is released (at
	which point the client is resized).

	The maximize button maximizes the client window in the available
	space on the root window (i.e. minus the width of the toolbox).
	Again, clients with set size increments are incremented and then
	centered in the desktop (so that means a maximized xterm may not
	take up the full screen).

	Client windows have a window menu accessable by clicking mouse
	button 3 (by default, the right button on a right handed mouse)
	on the window titlebar.  This window menu includes a submenu for
	sending the window to a different workspace, shade/unshade,
	iconify, maximize/unmaximize (if the client can be resized),
	close, raise, and lower functions.  The "Send To ..." submenu
	displays a list of available workspaces, which will send the
	window to the desired workspace if one is selected from the
	menu.  The window menu is retractable by pressing mouse button 3
	on the window titlebar a second time.

	Window shading can be simply explained as hiding all of the
	client window and decorations except for the title bar.  A
	window may be shaded or unshaded by either selecting the option
	from the window menu, or by clicking mouse button 1 on the
	titlebar while holding either of the control keys down.

Menu Behaviour:
	About menus in blackbox.  Other graphical interfaces allow menus
	to be traversed by holding mouse button 1 and moving the pointer.
	With blackbox, this is not the case.  Each menu item can be traversed
	by just moving the pointer.  In fact, holding button 1 while dragging
	the mouse doesn't do anything.  Submenus are automatically displayed,
	and highlighted accordingly.

	The session (root) menu is mapped by pressing mouse button 3 on
	the root window.  The menu title is centered around the
	pointer's current position, and thus it is possible to obscure
	part of the menu beyond the root window boundaries.  It is
	possible to move the root menu, in the same manner as moving a
	client window.  If an item is selected from the root menu or any
	of its submenus, the window will unmap itself UNLESS the user
	has interactively moved the menu, in which case it will remain
	on the root window until the user unmaps it by clicking mouse
	button 3 on its title.

	The workspace manager menu operates differently from the root
	menu in several respects.  It does not have a title, and thus is
	not movable.  Pressing the workspace name with button 1 on the toolbox
	maps the workspace manager menu.  The "New Workspace" menu item
	creates a new workspace, which is like a virtual X desktop on which
	more windows may be placed.  The "Delete last" menu item iconifies
	ALL windows on the last workspace, and removes the last workspace
	from blackbox's memory.  The number of workspaces is dynamic, but at
	least one must stay "alive". Because of this, the user cannot delete
	Workspace 0.

	Pressing one of the available workspaces in the menu with mouse
	button 1 changes to that workspace (i.e. all windows on the
	current workspace are hidden, and the windows on the selected
	workspace are shown) A workspace menu which contains a list of
	windows on any given workspace is available by pressing mouse
	button 3 on the workspace name.  If the user
	selects a window from the window list, blackbox will raise the selected
	window (move it to a visible location if it is not visible) and
	award it keyboard input focus.

Window Focusing / Key Bindings:
	Keyboard input focus is awarded to those clients who accept
	it (again, the client specifies if it can take focus through
	ICCCM protocol requests).  Blackbox disobeys the terms dicated
	by the ICCCM by allowing certain keyboard shortcuts (the ICCCM
	instructs window manager clients to not trap any key or pointer
	events from clients, until certain window manager function
	keys/key combinations are implemented).  The shortcut keys are
	as follows.  Mod1+Tab cycles window focus (skipping windows that
	do not accept focus and windows that are iconified).
	Control+Left/Right arrow key combinations will circulate through
	available workspaces, by ascending the workspace list (ALT+Left
	arrow) or descending it (ALT+Right arrow).  If the user tries to
	acsend above the first workspace, Blackbox will change to the
	last workspace (and vice versa for trying to descend past the
	last).

Icons:
	Icons are placed on the left side of the root window.  These icons
	are present in all workspaces,  thus it is possible to move a
	window to another workspace by iconifying it and then
	deiconifying it on a new workspace (but the Send To ... window
	menu function is much easier).  Blackbox reads the icon label
	from the ICCCM hints the client window sets.  If there is no
	icon label available, "Unnamed" is used (the same is true for
	window titles). Pressing the icon with mouse button 1 will deiconify
	the window on the current workspace (dissociating it from its original
	workspace if necessary).

Automatic Reconfiguration:
	*** OBSOLETE ***
	* Blackbox operates the same way any other window manager
	* operates.  It monitors events sent by the X server and deals
	* with them accordingly (like mapping a client window with or
	* without decorations, for example).  One event it also monitors
	* is a PropertyNotify event on the root window.  If the
	* RESOURCE_MANAGER property should change, blackbox rereads its
	* configuration and applies it to current and future windows,
	* menus, icons, etc.  Blackbox can also be forced to reread its
	* configuration via the menu (see the menu section below).
  	***

	NOTE:  Reading the RESOURCE_MANAGER property has proven to be
	less than stable, as it appears to work properly at times, and
	at times blackbox will core and exit.  Because of this a dialog
	has been created for the user to select whether or not blackbox
	should perform its reconfiguration, or wait until the user wants
	to reconfigure.

	UPDATE: This feature has been removed, haven been proven unstable and
	unreliable.  A new method of automatic reconfiguration will be
	implemented in later releases.


Configuration:
-----------------
Configuration of blackbox is not handled by a new rc file format, rather
X resources are used in the rc file (placed in the users home directory).
The default resources are read when there is no .blackboxrc file in the
users home directory.  If the default resource files cannot be found, then
blackbox uses a hard coded default (using flat textures).

Blackbox reads two configuration files to determine its appearance.  The
first file is the main configuration file, ~/.blackboxrc.  Blackbox reads this
file to determine colors, textures, fonts, and other relevant resources.  The
menu is read from a file set by a resource in this configuration file.

These are the X resources that Blackbox reads from its configuration
file:

	Any combination of:
		Bevel type:    Raised, Sunken, Flat
		Texture type:  Solid, Gradient

Accepted Value:
	an integer.  This resource controls how many workspaces are
	created when blackbox starts a new session (read, assumes
	control of an X display).


Name:					Class:
--------				---------
blackbox.session.titleFont		Blackbox.Session.TitleFont
blackbox.session.menuFont		Blackbox.Session.MenuFont
blackbox.session.iconFont		Blackbox.Session.IconFont

	any X font string.  if no resource is specified or if the font
	specified does not exist, a default font is loaded.
	The title font is the font used on window title bars, menu
	titles, and the workspace button on the toolbar.  the menu font
	is used on menu items, and the icon font is for icon labels


As an idea of how to configure blackbox, here is a snippet of my
resource file to configure Blackbox (~/.blackboxrc):

The Menu File:
-----------------
The menu file format has CHANGED.  Old menu files that follow the old
format will not get read AT ALL.  Blackbox now uses X resource to control
the root menu.

Blackbox looks for a resource in the menu file called:
	blackbox.session.rootMenu.topLevelMenu

This menu determines which menu is the root menu.  For example:
	blackbox*rootMenu.topLevelMenu:		topmenu
tells blackbox to read the menu named "topmenu" as the root menu.

Menus are read according to their name, label, number of items and the
actual menu items (in that order).  So, as an example, here is how the
default menu file would look:

	blackbox*rootMenu.topLevelMenu:		topmenu

	blackbox*topmenu.label:			Rootmenu
	blackbox*topmenu.item1.label:		xterm
	blackbox*topmenu.item1.exec:		xterm
	blackbox*topmenu.item2.label:		Restart
	blackbox*topmenu.item2.restart:		restart
	blackbox*topmenu.item3.label:		Exit
	blackbox*topmenu.item3.exit:		anyvalue
	blackbox*topmenu.totalItems:		3

This is a decent looking file format.  But then (you ask) why does the
number of items come AFTER the actual menu items?  The nice thing about
X resources is that they are a database, Blackbox looks for the one it
wants and READS the defaults in the order, so the file need not be in any
specific order (other than to make sense of it the next morning after
an allnight coding session).

Here is a synopsis of the menu format:

blackbox.session.rootMenu.topLevelMenu
		: menu to read as the rootmenu

blackbox.session.<menu_name>.label
		: menu label for <menu_name>

blackbox.session.<menu_name>.totalItems
		: total number of items for <menu_name>

blackbox.session.<menu_name>.itemX.label
		: item label for item X.  Blackbox will only read upto
		  50 items permenu (hardcoded default) so X should be
		  between 1 and 50

blackbox.session.<menu_name>.itemX.exec
		: string to execute when item is selected

blackbox.session.<menu_name>.itemX.submenu
		: string that provides a name for a submenu

blackbox.session.<menu_name>.itemX.restart
		: string that tells blackbox how to restart.  a value of
		  "restart" tells Blackbox to restart itself.  Any other
		  value and Blackbox tries to restart a different window
		  manager with the name of the specified value.

blackbox.sesssion.<menu_name>.itemX.reconfig
		: any value may be specified here.  Blackbox reconfigures
		  itself when this menu item is selected.

blackbox.session.<menu_name>.itemX.exit
		: any value may be specified here.  Blackbox dissociates
		  all windows and exits whtn this menu item is selected.


Again for an idea of how to configure the menu, here is my
blackbox.menu file (set by the resource in my .Xdefaults file):
