Blackbox has quickly become a very functional window manager, providing a fast
user interface, but at the loss of very patchy and unsightly code.  This file
is provided as an idea of what I plan to include and repair in Blackbox.
Ideas that people suggest are also included, provided they are feasible and
follow the plan I have set for Blackbox.  (First item on the todo... fix the
TODO file wording... ick)

Here is a listing of things I would like improved (and plan on improving):
DONE	- Since multiple threads share the same environment space, managing
	  multiple X displays from the same running executable isn't feasible
	  anymore, because Xlib reads the environment space to determine which
	  X server to connect to (hint:  echo $DISPLAY).

DONE	- Code cleanup to reflect the above (session lists and awkward restart
	  and shutdown functions)

	- make the toolbox do more... possibly drag and drop for starting
	  applications that set appropriate window hints (ala WindowMaker)
			OR
	- let toolbox applications be set via the resource configuration files
	  (favor the first idea)

	- bug fixes (provided the little bo0glies show their faces)

	- make wire moves, animations and animation stepping part of the
	  resource configuration instead of compile time operations

More to come...
